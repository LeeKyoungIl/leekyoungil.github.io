    p I have started my career as a application developers in 2008. Since then I have worked at various size of companies, startups to large enterprise and expanded my skill sets to include application developers, and system engineer. I am a passionate professional person who believes in importance of interactions between different roles at work. Trying to understand how operations work helped me to build better applications and I encourage my co-workers to understand the underlying infrastructures and systems in order to meet efficiency and pace of ever changing environment. I participate in various user groups, to learn about emerging technology trends and learn from other developers / architects / operators.
