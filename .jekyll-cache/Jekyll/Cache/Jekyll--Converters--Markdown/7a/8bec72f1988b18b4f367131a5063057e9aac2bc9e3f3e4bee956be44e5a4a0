<p>You can check disk partition in linux by the â€œdfâ€ command, the â€œ/dev/shmâ€ can be found.</p>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4101636/65818103-4931c800-e249-11e9-948a-753db12b3eba.png" alt="image" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Now, letâ€™s have a look at the screenshot. The size is 2G, the size is set half of the main memory.<br /></p>

<p>Donâ€™t worry. It is not actually assigned half of the main memory.
It is only assigned to memory when data save to that space.</p>

<p>The â€œ/dev/shmâ€ is the Virtual Memory FileSystem. It can access all of from the Linux Processes.</p>

<p>And You will see the â€œtmpfsâ€. Itâ€™s a filesystem. simply, H\W memory can use a like disk.</p>

<p>There is something similar. Itâ€™s a Ramdisk. The Ramdisk and the â€œtmpfsâ€ are the same as to save them in memory.</p>

<p>The difference is, the Ramdisk has a limit of space. But the â€œtmpfsâ€ is If other processes are located in the memory When the sum of the processes used memory size and the â€œ/dev/shm (tmpfs)â€ size over the memory size.<br /></p>

<p>The Linux will be using a swap partition. You know, When the swap partition is using, the system is slow down.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-we-check-before-using">What should We check before using?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, The â€œ/dev/shmâ€ can access all of the processes.
Because. We should be careful about file and directory permission.</p>

<p>We do better make a personal directory.</p>

<p>And the â€œ/dev/shmâ€ is a memory, and the memory is volatile. Because, When rebooting the system, all data will be deleted in the space.</p>

<h2 id="where-should-we-use-it">Where should we use it?</h2>

<p>In application. Sometimes we use a temporary file. In this situation easily change the path to the â€œ/dev/shmâ€, we will get fast I/O,
or We might be used for storage of batch process.</p>
